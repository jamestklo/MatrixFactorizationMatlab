\header {Solving DOM Attributes.}
Most DOM Attributes take the form of integers and strings.  

\header{Element vs. Node.}
% inheritance in CVC

\header{DOM Mutations.}
% conditional slicing

\header{Multiple Data Types.}

\header{Designer-Developer Collaboration.}
The majority of JavaScript bugs are DOM related~\cite{frolin2013}.
Ultimately, our higher level goal is to foster closer collaboration among designers and developers.\footnote{As part of separating concerns, design and development are often done by distinct individuals having very different backgrounds.}
For example, because \tool generates reference HTML for satisfying code execution, it can be used to detect DOM mismatches between the designer's HTML vs. what is expected in the developer's JavaScript code.  
A mismatch may not always be the developer's fault.  Sometimes it is possible that the designer may have made a mistake when updating the HTML or may be just too busy and have forgotten to notify the developer about a change.  

%XML, other programming languages 

% how about HTML5 canvas

\header{Other SMT Solvers.}
Microsoft Z3~\cite{z3}.  SMT-lib language.
