\header{Architecture.}
We architect our implementation so that we implement \tool only once in only one file.
Given an objective function, switching between gradient methods requires changing only one line of code.
That line of code is easily identifiable, locatable, modifiable and self-contained.
Changing that line of code also does not have any side-effects and does not require changing other lines of code.

\header{Batch Parallelism.}
When 
Re-computation can also run in parallel to the computation of new gradients.  

Moreover,
