\section{Introduction}
%Why RecSys
Shopping, text or display advertising, renting movies, listening to musicâ€¦ recommender systems are prevalent and ubiquitous in our daily lives.  
%Why Matrix Factorization
Matrix factorization (\emph{MF})is an important technique in model-based recommender systems.
The NetFlix Prize competition has shown that MF is superior to the classic nearest neighbour technique in product recommendations \cite{koren2009matrix}.
MF has been utilized extensively in past research for handling both explicit \cite{mmmf2005fast, mnar, gapfm} ratings, and implicit \cite{wrmf2008hu, wrmf2008pan, climf, bpr, mnar} feedback.

% Pitfalls with FG and SG
In recommender systems that utilize matrix factorization, all of them optimize an objective function.  
Moreover, all of the recommender systems that we mentioned utilize either of the following 2 main gradient methods for optimization: full deterministic gradient (\emph{FG}) \cite{mmmf2005fast, wrmf2008hu, wrmf2008pan, mnar}, or stochastic gradient (\emph{SG}) \cite{gapfm, climf, bpr}.
However, both FG and SG have pitfalls.  

%Why SAG in prototyping model-based recommender systems


To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
\begin{compactitem}
\item Identify the pitfalls associated with using full deterministic gradient and stochastic gradient when data scientists prototype model-based recommender systems.
\item Propose Stochastic Average Gradient (SAG) as a viable alternative for yielding better and faster convergence in optimizing objective functions.
\item Extend SAG into SAG-MF, and resolve the space complexity challenge in adapting SAG from the domain of supervised machine learning into matrix factorization.
\item Prove in theory, that SAG-MF has identical asymptotic time complexity and identical asymptotic space complexity as Stochastic Gradient.
\item Extensively evaluate and compare SAG-MF across multiple RecSys objective functions and diverse datasets.
\item Demonstrate in practice that, even before optimization, SAG-MF still yields faster, better convergence despite the additional time of re-computation, and that SAG-MF uses memory at a level similar to stochastic gradient.

2. Unit testing JavaScript functions required the DOM as input, not any DOM but the DOM in a specific structure
